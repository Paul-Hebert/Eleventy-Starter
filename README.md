# Eleventy-Starter

**(WIP)** A basic JAMStack setup with Eleventy and Gulp. I commonly end up scaffolding similar patterns. This includes some of that work to make starting other projects quicker.

This supports a pattern library, a prototyping environment, and an area for production pages.

It uses handlebars for templating, Sass for CSS processing, and ~~Rollup for javascript transpilation and bundling~~.

You're not meant to include this as a module. Instead, clone this as a starting point for your project and then tweak it to fit your needs. This makes it easier to directly edit the configuration without this project acting as a middleman between you and your config files.
